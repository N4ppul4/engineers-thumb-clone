Compression guitar pedal clone

Just my take on the popular compression pedal, its designed to use with perfboard.
This is not in any means verified or anything so take it with a grain of salt.
Program used for schematics and pcb layout is KiCad

Dont know much about copyrights so I assume its same as original design
